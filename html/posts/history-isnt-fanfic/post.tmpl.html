<p>Ever since I was a kid, my family has helped me to appreciate
history.</p>
<p>There’s the usual warm memories of my dad and I watching the HISTORY
channel and him telling me how crazy Hitler was for invading Russia in
the winter.</p>
<p>My uncle too when he’d drive me to Catholic class as a kid would tell
me about how big the blast radius of a nuke was or who was the best
president or even about a war between Mexico and the US 150 years
ago.</p>
<p>We’d go on trips from DC to St. Augustine here in the states to
foreign places like Chichen Itza, the Vatican, and even Bethlehem.</p>

<p>Eventually, I carried over this interest to my high school years in
nerdy ways: history bowl tournaments and paradox history games.</p>
<h3>gamification</h3>
<p>I’ll start out with history bowl since that’s way less known.</p>
<p>History bowl is a 4 vs. 4 trivia competition with four rounds with
varying rule that don’t really matter here. Basically, a question is
read aloud, and each team has a chance to buzz in as it’s read to get
the points. Your team gets only one buzz per question, and there’s no
communication allowed; each member just has to know their stuff.</p>
<p>The big thing that made it so unique to whatever kahoot history
trivia game you might’ve played with a sub was the questions. Question
sets in an average history bowl game are very scattered. Here is a
little sample of what I mean:</p>
<hr />
<p><strong><em>NOTE</em></strong>: If you wanna play at home, scroll
down one line at a time until you think you know the answer then check
to see if it’s right.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This process led to the martyring of the Bandiera Brothers. The
Battle of Solferino helped accelerate this process by forcing Austria to
cede land in the Treaty of Zürich. This process spread to the southern
regions with the Expedition of the Thousand. Count Cavour helped
engineer this process alongside Giuseppe Garibaldi. For ten points, name
this process which resulted in a new nation centered at Rome.</p>
<p>ANSWER: <strong>Italian unification</strong> (accept the
<strong>Risorgimento</strong>)</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>For designing one of these facilities, John Cockcroft and Ernest
Walton won a Nobel Prize in 1951. After already spending 2 billion
dollars, the development of one of these facilities named the SSC was
canceled by Congress in 1993. Public safety concerns were raised after
people thought one of these facilities built by CERN was capable of
producing black holes. The Tevatron and the RHIC are examples of, for
ten points, what scientific devices used to study physics at the atomic
level, such as the Large Hadron Collider?</p>
<p>ANSWER: <strong>particle accelerator</strong>s (prompt on
“atom-smasher” and other colloquial terms for a thing that bashes
particles together and/or makes them go really fast</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Description acceptable. Thomas Aquinas cited Genesis 1:28 [chapter 1,
verse 28] as Biblical justification for this general action, so long as
it was used as a means to divine happiness. The “spoilage” and “enough
and as good” provisions limit the right to this practice, according to
John Locke, who stated that this practice became legitimate through the
mixing of labor. Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality blames all the
world’s “crimes, wars, and murders” on this practice, which takes place
through enclosure of the commons. For ten points, name this practice
that Locke sought to protect alongside life and liberty.</p>
<p>ANSWER: <strong>own</strong>ing private <strong>property</strong>
(accept equivalents; accept descriptions relating to
<strong>buy</strong>ing <strong>property</strong>; accept
<strong>land</strong>, <strong>goods</strong>, <strong>thing</strong>s,
etc. as substitutes for property; accept the <strong>pursuit of
property</strong> and similar phrases after “spoilage” is read; prompt
on partial answers)</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Political, scientific, and philosophical history all from the
same <a

set</a> (there’s also a popcorn question I almost added)</em></p>
<hr />
<p>For anyone lucky enough to not know, <em>Hearts of Iron IV</em> and
all the other similar paradox games like <em>Europa Universalis IV</em>
and (my favorite) <em>Victoria II</em> are massive strategy games that
attempt to simulate playing a state from 1444-1950 with in-game armies,
economies, and diplomacy.</p>
<p>This stuff is real nerdy and takes sooo much time to learn and play,
but it was a great source of fun and giving real color to what the Holy
Roman Empire actually was or why a place as tiny as Haiti would be as
wealthy and desired as it was in the seventeenth century or any boring
fact that turns into solid game mechanics you interact with to simulate
being Richelieu for an evening.</p>

<p>Cause of these games and way too much time studying nonsense, I got
to be the ‘politics/war guy’ on my history bowl team answering all the
questions relating to Tamerlane or German Unification or the Spanish
Civil War.</p>
<p>The most skilled person on our team was a big <em>Sabaton</em> fan,
and he’d be the first to buzz in when he heard anything about WWI or the
Northern War.</p>
<p>Even though I’m glad to’ve grown out of it by now, I’m still really
happy with the teenage years I spent in history bowl and <em>Vicky
2</em>. The stuff I learned then gave me the cognitive ease to learn
about history today.</p>
<h3>the past as narrative</h3>
<p>When I went to study math in college, I gave up learning any kind of
real history from professors or with my peers. Getting into proofs was
awesome, but I still wanted to continue all I’d learned from high
school.</p>
<p>I had no reason to memorize facts about French presidents or Indian
wars anymore, so I didn’t. Instead, I transformed my love of history
from just trivia-hoarding into a real appreciation for one of the most
ancient of the humanities.</p>
<p>One thing I learned pretty early on was how cool historical
narratives actually are. I read a lot of history books in high school
but mostly for the sake of AP tests and extracting trivia from them. One
legendary book that kept me curious my freshman year was <em>The Rise
and Fall of the Third Reich</em> by William L. Shirer. A book I loved
reading this summer was <em>How to Hide an Empire</em> by Daniel
Immerwahr.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just nonfiction books and documentaries either. I’ve
learned to appreciate a lot more art that uses the past as allegory for
the artist’s present. One of my favorite albums, <a
href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kZO_N8NZHVD9gzKcCWMAqsVBlUf2H6pcU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deceit</em></a>
is rooted in the left anti-war movements of the late ’70s and interlaces
Latin conjugations, historical and biblical allusions, and really cool
drumming to hold a mirror to our own brutality and lies. Instead of just
saying how cool Spartans were, This Heat uses their references to make
us reckon with some dark stuff.</p>

<h3>dialogue as a medium of history</h3>
<p>Something really useful I wish I knew sooner is how easy it is to
email historians and authors. I’ve contacted quite a few about history
questions and asking for book recommendations to keep reading more cool
stuff. And I guess that leads to my main way of engaging with the past
in my life.</p>
<p>History is a humanity, and the best way I’ve found to learn
humanities is talking to other real people. I reconnected with my
American history teacher I had in high school, and discussing with him
how history shapes the world today has been the biggest shift in how I
think about the past.</p>
<p>The main issue with <em>Sabaton</em> and <em>HOI4</em> and all these
other autistic expressions of interest in history is turning our
ancestors into fan fiction. It’s so easy to go into these things with
the idea that the fall of Byzantium is equivalent to Death Star blowing
up Alderaan or how Hitler is just like Voldemort or other silly thoughts
like that cause of how separated it is from real human beings.</p>
<p>So reading books is great, talking to historians is great, but the
best way of experience history second-hand is the times I get to talk to
the real actors of that make our world turn.</p>
<p>I got to talk with Chileans that became revolutionaries and overthrew
Peñera. I’ve spoken with both veterans and protestors of Vietnam and
Iraq telling me their stories. I’ve studied from Russian immigrants that
fled the collapsing USSR and had to leave their families like how my own
was uprooted from Mexico. And lastly I’ve heard Jews tell me their their
times in the kibbutz and the Israeli government coaxing them to settle
former Arab land.</p>
<h3>israel/palestine</h3>
<p>I planned on writing this article well before October 7, but I think
it’s more important than ever to share. Everyone should stand up to the
massacre being committed in Gaza right now.</p>
<p>There was a real crime that happened to innocent Israelis and Jews by
Hamas, but instead of seeking real justice and finding a way to end the
violence, the Israeli government sees this how Austrian General Franz
Conrad von Hötzendorf saw the death of Franz Ferdinand: “…a gift from
Mars.”</p>
<p>Now we get to see the IDF cut food, water, and electricity from an
already besieged population and force hundreds of thousands to flee
their homes then bomb them in refugee camps anyways. At present, 6,000
women and children have died to “the most moral army in the world.”</p>
<p>This isn’t really new. Any honest student of history can see the
obvious expansionist and colonial nature of the State of Israel. They’ve
invaded, bombed, and terrorized their neighbors for decades. Within
their own defacto borders, they’ve been massacring their captive Arab
population and calling it war with invented phrases like “mowing the
lawn” but older words are more honest about what the IDF has done to
Palestine: pogroms, terrorism, and genocide.</p>

</figure>
<p>The main point of learning history isn’t for entertainment; it’s for
using the past as a new avenue for empathy. It’s about cutting through
lies and caring about people over governments, condemning colonialism
and hatred for anyone, not just Jews. It’s not about debating whether or
not states have a right to exist but rather defending people’s right to
exercise that privilege themselves.</p>
<p>Gazans and Palestinians need good people standing with them now more
than ever. I gave what I could to charity, and I encourage you to do the
same:</p>
