## history isn't fanfic

**tl;dr:** donate to [palestinian charities](#charities) and stand up against
israeli terrorism (while listening to

Ever since I was a kid, my family has helped me to appreciate history.

There's the usual warm memories of my dad and I watching the HISTORY channel
and him telling me how crazy Hitler was for invading Russia in the winter.

My uncle too when he'd drive me to Catholic class as a kid would tell me about
how big the blast radius of a nuke was or who was the best president or even
about a war between Mexico and the US 150 years ago.

We'd go on trips from DC to St. Augustine here in the states to foreign places
like Chichen Itza, the Vatican, and even Bethlehem.

Eventually, I carried over this interest to my high school years in nerdy ways:
history bowl tournaments and paradox history games.

### gamification

I'll start out with history bowl since that's way less known.

History bowl is a 4 vs. 4 trivia competition with four rounds with varying rule
that don't really matter here. Basically, a question is read aloud, and each
team has a chance to buzz in as it's read to get the points. Your team gets
only one buzz per question, and there's no communication allowed; each member
just has to know their stuff.

The big thing that made it so unique to whatever kahoot history trivia game you
might've played with a sub was the questions. Question sets in an average
history bowl game are very scattered. Here is a little sample of what I mean:

***NOTE***: If you wanna play at home, scroll down one line at a time until you
think you know the answer then check to see if it's right.

*Political, scientific, and philosophical history all from the same [game
set](https://usa.iacompetitions.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2023/08/2017-2018-HS-History-Bowl-Round-6-A-Set.pdf) (there's also a popcorn question I almost added)*

***

For anyone lucky enough to not know, *Hearts of Iron IV* and all the
other similar paradox games like *Europa Universalis IV* and (my favorite)
*Victoria II* are massive strategy games that attempt to simulate playing a
state from 1444-1950 with in-game armies, economies, and diplomacy.

This stuff is real nerdy and takes sooo much time to learn and play, but it was
a great source of fun and giving real color to what the Holy Roman Empire
actually was or why a place as tiny as Haiti would be as wealthy and desired as
it was in the seventeenth century or any boring fact that turns into solid game
mechanics you interact with to simulate being Richelieu for an evening.

Cause of these games and way too much time studying nonsense, I got to be the
'politics/war guy' on my history bowl team answering all the questions relating
to Tamerlane or German Unification or the Spanish Civil War.

The most skilled person on our team was a big *Sabaton* fan, and he'd be
the first to buzz in when he heard anything about WWI or the Northern War.

Even though I'm glad to've grown out of it by now, I'm still really happy with
the teenage years I spent in history bowl and *Vicky 2*. The stuff I learned
then gave me the cognitive ease to learn about history today.

### the past as narrative

When I went to study math in college, I gave up learning any kind of real
history from professors or with my peers. Getting into proofs was awesome, but
I still wanted to continue all I'd learned from high school.

I had no reason to memorize facts about French presidents or Indian wars
anymore, so I didn't. Instead, I transformed my love of history from just
trivia-hoarding into a real appreciation for one of the most ancient of the
humanities.

One thing I learned pretty early on was how cool historical narratives actually
are. I read a lot of history books in high school but mostly for the sake of AP
tests and extracting trivia from them. One legendary book that kept me curious
my freshman year was *The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich* by William L.
Shirer. A book I loved reading this summer was *How to Hide an Empire* by
Daniel Immerwahr.

This wasn't just nonfiction books and documentaries either. I've learned to
appreciate a lot more art that uses the past as allegory for the artist's
present. One of my favorite albums,
[*Deceit*](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kZO_N8NZHVD9gzKcCWMAqsVBlUf2H6pcU)
is rooted in the left anti-war movements of the late '70s and interlaces Latin
conjugations, historical and biblical allusions, and really cool drumming to hold a mirror to
our own brutality and lies. Instead of just saying how cool Spartans were, This
Heat uses their references to make us reckon with some dark stuff.

### dialogue as a medium of history

Something really useful I wish I knew sooner is how easy it is to email
historians and authors. I've contacted quite a few about history questions and
asking for book recommendations to keep reading more cool stuff. And I guess
that leads to my main way of engaging with the past in my life.

History is a humanity, and the best way I've found to learn humanities is
talking to other real people. I reconnected with my American history teacher I
had in high school, and discussing with him how history shapes the world today
has been the biggest shift in how I think about the past.

The main issue with *Sabaton* and *HOI4* and all these other autistic
expressions of interest in history is turning our ancestors into fan fiction.
It's so easy to go into these things with the idea that the fall of Byzantium
is equivalent to Death Star blowing up Alderaan or how Hitler is just like
Voldemort or other silly thoughts like that cause of how separated it is from
real human beings.

So reading books is great, talking to historians is great, but the best way of
experience history second-hand is the times I get to talk to the real actors of
that make our world turn.

I got to talk with Chileans that became revolutionaries and overthrew Peñera.
I've spoken with both veterans and protestors of Vietnam and Iraq telling me
their stories. I've studied from Russian immigrants that fled the collapsing
USSR and had to leave their families like how my own was uprooted from Mexico.
And lastly I've heard Jews tell me their their times in the kibbutz and the
Israeli government coaxing them to settle former Arab land.

### israel/palestine

I planned on writing this article well before October 7, but I think it's
more important than ever to share. Everyone should stand up to the massacre
being committed in Gaza right now.

There was a real crime that happened to innocent Israelis and Jews by Hamas,
but instead of seeking real justice and finding a way to end the violence, the
Israeli government sees this how Austrian General Franz Conrad von Hötzendorf
saw the death of Franz Ferdinand: "...a gift from Mars."

Now we get to see the IDF cut food, water, and electricity from an already
besieged population and force hundreds of thousands to flee their homes then
bomb them in refugee camps anyways. At present, 6,000 women and children have
died to "the most moral army in the world."

This isn't really new. Any honest student of history can see the obvious
expansionist and colonial nature of the State of Israel. They've invaded,
bombed, and terrorized their neighbors for decades. Within their own defacto
borders, they've been massacring their captive Arab population and calling it
war with invented phrases like "mowing the lawn" but older words are more
honest about what the IDF has done to Palestine: pogroms, terrorism, and
genocide.

![This is what ethnic cleansing looks like](/static/posts/history-isnt-fanfic/img/palestine_map.png){alt="famous four maps of arab land being eaten from 1947 till present"}

The main point of learning history isn't for entertainment; it's for using the
past as a new avenue for empathy. It's about cutting through lies and caring
about people over governments, condemning colonialism and hatred for anyone,
not just Jews. It's not about debating whether or not states have a right to
exist but rather defending people's right to exercise that privilege
themselves.

Gazans and Palestinians need good people standing with them now more than ever.
I gave what I could to charity, and I encourage you to do the same:

* [Anera](https://www.anera.org/)
* [UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East](https://www.unrwa.org/)
* [Medical Aid for Palestinians](https://www.map.org.uk/)
