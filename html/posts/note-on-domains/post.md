## note on domains

*just some minor updates and subdomain aspirations.*

I bought the [angelcastaneda.org](https://www.angelcastaneda.org/) domain
recently for making a "coding portfolio" to replace evil linkedin. I'm
moving this personal blog to my cool hacker domain
[acsq.me](https://www.acsq.me/). angel-castaneda.com will be retired in a few
months back to ICANN. from dust to dust.

acsq.me is shorthand for AC^2 or acsquared: my initials for my full(ish) name.
I wanted it to be as short as possible to attached modules to it like my git
server at [git.acsq.me](https://git.acsq.me), postgresql+mariadb servers at
db.acsq.me, and [alps webmail](https://sr.ht/~migadu/alps/) at mail.acsq.me.

I'm hoping to add some more subdomain modules for
[peertube](https://joinpeertube.org/) (vids.acsq.me),
[mycorrhiza](https://mycorrhiza.wiki/) (wiki.acsq.me), [xmpp](https://xmpp.org)
(several subdomains) and maybe a subdomain for my apis I'm messing around with
(api.acsq.me), but I'm getting way too aspirational now.

and lastly, I've updated my public pgp key to adding email identities for
[me@angelcastaneda.org](mailto:me@angelcastaneda.org),
[yo@angelcastaneda.org](mailto:yo@angelcastaneda.org), +
[ich@angelcastaneda.org](mailto:ich@angelcastaneda.org) to my key, so in case
you have my older pub, I can decrypt it just fine, but it won't have my newer
identities. It may also sign funny but I haven't checked myself, so please
[update](/angelcastaneda.asc) if you care about that stuff.
